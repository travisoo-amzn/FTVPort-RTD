    General Dos and Don’ts 
Dos

* Always stick to your talking points. Be very controlled in your conversations and be sure you follow the guidance of what we’ve announced to date. 
* Be comfortable saying “I don’t know” if you don’t know.
* If asked, you can refer media or analysts to collmcca@amazon (US) or creuie@amazon.fr (FR)
* Remember that anything you say can be used in a story. There is no such thing as “off the record.” 
* Be careful even when you’re not in the booth—reporters will be all over, so be sure to be cognizant of what you’re saying and your surroundings the entire time (e.g., bathrooms, lounges, restaurants, etc.).
* Use the actual names for features or devices, not the code names.

 
Don’ts

* Conduct any formal interviews with a media or an analyst, refer further questions beyond the demo to PR contacts list above. 
* Comment on rumors or speculation.
* Release information or statistics that have not been cleared by AR/PR.
* Talk about the future or speculate on features or services that are rumored.
* Talk about/name the competition or perceived competition (other companies)—we are heads-down focused on customers.
* Talk about anyone you don’t want a reporter to call.
* Talk about the stock price or revenue/profitability numbers, even anecdotally.
* Talk “off the record.” There is no such thing. Don’t say anything you would not want to see in print.
* Talk about business details like your team size, roles and responsibilities on your team, etc.
* Answer questions you are not asked. Elaborating could reveal sensitive information.
* Give out your business card to media.

 
Helpful Tips & Tricks  
Here are some responses to remember when dealing with difficult questions (outside of questions from reporters and analysts, which you should always refer to a PR representative to handle): 

* “I’m not the right person to answer that.”
* “I don’t know the answer to that.”
* “We don’t break out those numbers/disclose that info, but what I can tell you is…”
* “I can’t comment on rumors, but I can tell you we’re working hard to bring all sorts of new features and products to our customers.”
