**Details**

Zoox has expanded its autonomous vehicle operations to Las Vegas, marking the first time a fully driverless, purpose-built robotaxi is operating on public roads in Nevada.

**Key Developments:**

* Deployment in Las Vegas: Since June 2023, Zoox's robotaxi has been navigating public roads in Las Vegas without a driver, steering wheel, or pedals. 
* Operational Geofence Expansion: Testing began around Zoox's Las Vegas headquarters and has now extended to include the Las Vegas Strip and surrounding areas. The Strip presents complex driving scenarios, such as multiple lanes, high speeds, heavy pedestrian traffic, and large intersections.
* Testing and Rider Programs: Currently, rides are available to Zoox employees, with plans to include employees' families and friends soon. In early 2025, the "Zoox Explorers" program will offer external riders the opportunity to experience the service at no charge.
* Infrastructure and Team Growth: Since arriving in Las Vegas in 2019, Zoox has expanded its facilities, including a 190,000-square-foot warehouse for vehicles and additional office space. The company continues to grow its team to support operations, maintenance, and rider services.
* Future Goals: Zoox aims to provide driverless rides to the Las Vegas public in the short term.
The ultimate objective is to enhance urban safety, cleanliness, and enjoyment through autonomous transportation.
These advancements in Las Vegas are integral to Zoox's mission to reinvent transportation and prepare for a commercial launch in 2025.
