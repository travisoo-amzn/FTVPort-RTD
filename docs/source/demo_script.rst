* Welcome to Fire TV! Let me ask, what shows are you watching right now?

    * Alexa on Fire TV can recommend movies/shows based on how you are feeling, the vibe you’re looking for, based on other shows or movies you love, such as what you’re watching now. We have a fun activity here using these tarot cards to find your next great show
        
        * Demo- ask them to flip over one card from the “prompts deck” and one card from the “movie/show” deck.

            * “Alexa, recommend a [insert prompt] that is similar to [movie/show name]
           
            * Example “Alexa, recommend a lighthearted show similar to the office
