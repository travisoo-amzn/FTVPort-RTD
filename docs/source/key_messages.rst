Key Messages
###########

    * Fire TV captures customer attention BEFORE they begin streaming. 
        * Fire TV puts your ads front and center during the dedicated moments when consumers are searching for content/what to watch next. Consumers are not distracted by phones, they are focused on the UI where your ads are appearing
    * Fire TV is different than a streaming app like Prime Video, Netflix, or Disney+. It is a content aggregator and provides an opportunity to fix the challenge of streaming fragmentation.
        * Streaming fragmentation- customers are using multiple apps (average of 7 on Fire TV each month). This requires advertisers to spend on multiple apps. However, with Fire TV, you are starting from the moment the customer turns on the TV and through Amazonâ€™s DSP, we can show your ads through the entire streaming journey.  
    * If you are new to Fire TV, we want you to begin with our hero advertising placement, the Feature Rotator. The Feature Rotator is an auto play video placement with audio, that puts your brand at the heart of the streaming experience
    * When you advertise with Fire TV, we are bringing incremental reach to with minimal overlap. When advertisers add Fire TV to Prime Video Ad campaigns, we increase reach by 177% with just 5% audience overlap
