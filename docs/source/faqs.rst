   General


* Is this experience using Alexa+? 
    * This TV is Alexa+ enabled and it helps customers to find something to watch in a way that’s more natural, interactive, and helpful. All our customers though, no matter which Fire TV devices they’re using, have access to all their favorite local apps to find content they want to watch quickly and easily. 



* Is Alexa+ available on Fire TV now? 
    * We’ve started to roll out Alexa+ to a small number of customers. 



* What does “early access” mean?
    * We’re giving a small number of customers who expressed interest an early look at Alexa+. Right now, we’re focused on getting their feedback as we put the finishing touches on the product ahead of its general release. 



* When will “early access” end?
    * It’s hard to say. This is a brand-new service and  we’re being thoughtful about when and how this is rolled out to customers.



* When can I (reporter/influencer) get  access to review?
    * We aren’t doing reviews of Alexa+ right now—that’s not  something we typically do before a product is generally available. Right  now, we’re focused on learning from customers and refining the experience.  We can stay in touch as we get closer to GA.



* Is Alexa+ available in France/Which countries will Alexa+ be available in?
    * Alexa+ is available in English to customers in the U.S. to start, and will begin expanding to additional countries later this year. 


Ads-Specific

* What is the demographic structure of Fire TV users? Broken down by age group?
    * Fire TV has substantial global reach. We have sold 250 Million Fire TV devices globally and we have significant presence in key regions including the US, CA, MX, BR, UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, AU, IN, JP. V. While I can't share specific age demographic data here, I would be happy to follow up with detailed demographic information for your region of interest. Fire TV's extensive reach combined with Amazon Ads integration enables precise customer targeting capabilities to meet your advertising objectives.
* Which app is used the most on FireTV? For example, many customers go to Netflix, is this a good opportunity to reach people again via Fire TV?
    * We love this question. So different than a streaming service like Netflix, Fire TV aggregates content and allows our customers to decide what they want to watch. On average, in the US, consumers use about 7 different streaming apps per month. So with Fire TV, like we discussed, you are capturing customer attention BEFORE they stream. Then when a customer does stream, with Amazon’s DSP, your video ads appear across the vast network of Amazon apps and 3rd party apps. We don't publicly disclose though which apps are used the most on Fire TV.
* How is Fire TV different than Prime Video?
    * TV is a connected TV operating system that powers devices like Fire TV Stick and Fire TV smart TVs, while Prime Video is simply one streaming app available on this platform. Think of Fire TV as the iPhone's iOS system that allows you to download and access various streaming apps including Prime Video, Netflix, YouTube, and others. For advertisers currently using Prime Video, expanding to Fire TV offers significant benefits—our data shows campaigns gain 77% incremental reach with only 5% audience overlap when combining both platforms.



* What are the differences between Fire TV and other connected OS like Samsung (Tizen), LG (WebOS), Vizio (SmartCast), Google/Android TV and Roku?
    * Fire TV is our streaming entertainment operating system that powers both Amazon-branded devices and third-party smart TVs. What makes Fire TV distinctive is its versatility—it's available both as streaming media players that connect to existing TVs and integrated directly into smart TVs. Amazon smart TVs with Fire TV Built in deliver the same great experience customers have come to expect from Fire TV, with the added benefit of not needing to purchase any additional hardware.
